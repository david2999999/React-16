Pure functions are naturally testable. They do not change anything
about their environment or “world,” and therefore do not require a
complicated test setup or teardown. Everything a pure function
needs to operate it accesses via arguments. When testing a pure
function, you control the arguments, and thus you can estimate the
outcome

When writing
functions, try to follow these three rules:
1. The function should take in at least one argument.
2. The function should return a value or another function.
3. The function should not change or mutate any of its arguments
