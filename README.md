## React 
React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library
for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a 
community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile 
applications, as it's optimal only for its intended use of being the
quickest method to fetch rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded.
However, fetching data is only the beginning of what happens on a web page, 
which is why complex React applications usually require the use of additional 
libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.
